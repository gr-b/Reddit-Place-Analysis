It was one of the many early color nations like blue, purple, red, and green.  Unlike the other color nations, pink attracted \"The Followers of Pink\", a loose philosophy built not on war or overwriting, but on simply spreading the warm embrace of pink throughout the canvas.  In this way The Followers of Pink were similar to The Void or Erase This Place, but without an interest in overwriting. Their interest was in peace and simply filling the monochrome (the blank canvas) with the warm peaceful embrace of pink.  \nA few gathered under r/PinkUnion, but were never highly organized.  The region saw fierce battles early on.  First in the south eastern corner where The Blue Corners impending wave hammered away at The Pink Province.  Next at the south western corner where a rainbow (possibly associated with r/ainbowroad) ultimately succeeded in passing through.  The Followers of Pink and r/PinkUnion fought valiantly to preserve the Pink Province and Sovereign Triangle, but the final blow came when the osu! began construction of their second larger logo. Construction began without consent, and ultimately the moderators of r/PinkUnion agreed to a treaty.  Several of The Followers of Pink saw this as an affront to an established pink space, the Sovereign Triangle, which in a rapidly filling canvas became symbolic.  So while osu! constructed their much larger logo with a near mechanical efficiency, The Followers of Pink and supporters fought back by filling the letters and areas that were once The Sovereign Triangle with pink pixels (and other colors).  Due to the pink background of the osu! logo, numerous onslaughts, the disparate nature of The Followers of Pink, and the small size of r/PinkUnion, The Sovereign Triangle was ultimately lost to history.  Though, the battles for, and evidence of, The Sovereign Triangle and Pink Province remain ever evident in the data.

It is bordered to the west by the province of Ontario, James Bay, and Hudson Bay; to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay; to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and to the south by the province of New Brunswick and the US states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia.\n\nQuebec is Canada's second-most populous province, after Ontario. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the Saint Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City, the capital. Approximately half of Quebec residents live in the Greater Montreal Area, including the Island of Montreal. English-speaking communities and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the island of Montreal but are also significantly present in the Outaouais, Eastern Townships, and Gaspé regions. The Nord-du-Québec region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by Aboriginal peoples. The climate around the major cities is four-season continental with cold and snowy winters combined with warm to hot humid summers, but further north long winter seasons dominate and as a result the northern areas of the province are marked by tundra conditions. Even in central Quebec at comparatively southerly latitudes winters are severe in inland areas.\n\nQuebec independence debates have played a large role in the politics of the province. Parti Québécois governments held referendums on sovereignty in 1980 and 1995; both were voted down by voters, the latter defeated by a very narrow margin.[14] In 2006, the House of Commons of Canada passed a symbolic motion recognizing the \"Québécois as a nation within a united Canada.\"\n\nWhile the province's substantial natural resources have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the knowledge economy such as aerospace, information and communication technologies, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical industry also play leading roles. These many industries have all contributed to helping Quebec become an economically influential province within Canada, second only to Ontario in economic output.\n-Wikipedia",    	"website": "",    	"subreddit": "/r/Quebec",    	"center": [    		399.5,    		237.5    	],    	"path": [    		[    			383.5,    			232.5    		],    		[    			416.5,    			232.5    		],    		[    			416.5,    			241.5    		],    		[    			382.5,    			241.5    		],    		[    			382.5,    			232.5    		]    	]    }

This guy just wanted the text \"Lehigh\" there to represent his university, again we came to a compromise together. \nBut then, after 3 days of cooperation with strangers and battling griefers, about 20 minutes before /r/place was going to end, came the Lehigh university marching band, \"Lehigh 97\". They did not want the text to simply represent their university, it had to represent their marching band. So they trampled their \"97\" over our \"ca\". We were outnumbered. Even the original creator of \"Lehigh\" tried to help stopping them destroying our very small project. We were proud of being able to keep our pixels alive in the giant internet WW3 for 3 days long.

Information suggested the void would not target the UK directly due to its strength, instead destroying the area below and moving west into Italy.\n\nAn agreement between the two countries was reached. The UK would expand its considerable botnet to cover the entirety of the Italian flag. In return, Italy would help to build Big Ben in the space the void left after destroying Mexico.\n\nThe void attacked once more. Many smaller projects were destroyed to the south, outside of the UK's area of protection. However, UK and Italy stood strong, barely able to harm either country.
